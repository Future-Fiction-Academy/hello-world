# Hello World — Python/Flask Starter for Vibe Coding

A minimal Flask app designed to be your **starting point** for AI-assisted coding. Fork it, open it in a web-based AI coding tool, make your changes, then let Railway deploy automatically when you merge.

---

## The Workflow

### 1 — Fork this repo

Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy under your GitHub account.

### 2 — Open in your AI coding tool

Open your fork in an AI coding tool:

- **Claude Code** (online/desktop)
- **Codex** (online/desktop)
- Other

### 3 — Make your changes

Use the AI to modify the app however you like. Your changes will be saved to a new feature branch in your fork automatically.

### 4 — Create a Pull Request

When you're happy with your changes, open a Pull Request from your feature branch back to `main` on your fork.

### 5 — Review and Merge

Review the PR — check the diff, leave a comment, get comfortable with the process — then merge it into `main`.

### 6 — Railway deploys automatically

Merging to `main` triggers Railway to deploy your updated app. Visit your Railway URL to see the changes live.

## Create Your Own "Deploy to Railway" Button

Once you've built something worth sharing, you can create a one-click deploy button for your own project.

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app) and sign in.
2. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select your repo.
3. Deploy once so Railway creates the project.
4. Open project **Settings**.
5. Click **Generate Template from Project** (or **Create Template**).
6. Copy your new template URL:
   - `https://railway.app/new/template/<YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID>`
   - or `https://railway.com/template/<YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID>`
7. Add the button to your README:

```md
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/YOUR-TEMPLATE-ID-HERE)
```

Optional: append `?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button` for analytics.

To make your template publicly discoverable, go to Railway Templates and click **Publish**.
